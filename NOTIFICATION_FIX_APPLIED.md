# Notification Loading Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem Identified
The console logs showed that `fetchNotifications` was being called **multiple times in rapid succession**, causing:
- Multiple simultaneous API requests
- Some requests timing out after 5 seconds
- Loading state getting stuck because of race conditions

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `useEffect` dependencies:
1. `fetchNotifications` was included in the dependency array
2. `fetchNotifications` was recreated on every render (due to `user` dependency)
3. This caused the `useEffect` to re-run infinitely
4. Each time the dropdown opened, it triggered another fetch

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed useEffect Dependencies
**Before:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    fetchNotifications();
  }
}, [user, fetchNotifications]); // ❌ fetchNotifications causes infinite loop
```

**After:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    fetchNotifications();
  }
}, [user]); // ✅ Only depend on user
```

### 2. Removed Redundant Refresh
**Before:**
- Notifications fetched on mount
- Notifications fetched every 30 seconds
- Notifications fetched when dropdown opens ❌ (unnecessary)

**After:**
- Notifications fetched on mount
- Notifications fetched every 30 seconds
- No fetch when dropdown opens ✅ (uses existing data)

### 3. Added Better Logging
All fetch operations now log to console for easier debugging.

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **On Login**: Fetch notifications once
2. **Every 30 seconds**: Automatic refresh (background)
3. **Click Bell Icon**: Show existing notifications (no fetch)
4. **No More**: Infinite loops, timeouts, or stuck loading states

## Test It

1. Clear your browser console
2. Click the notification bell
3. You should see:
   - Notification dropdown opens immediately
   - Only 1-2 fetch operations in console
   - No timeout warnings
   - Loading spinner disappears quickly

## If Still Having Issues

Check console for:
- "Setting up periodic refresh" - Should only appear once per session
- Multiple "Starting fetch" messages - Should be minimal
- "Request timeout" - Should not appear unless network is slow

The infinite loop is now fixed!

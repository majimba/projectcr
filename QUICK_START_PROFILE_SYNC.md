# Quick Start: Profile & Team Members Sync

## What's New? 🎉

Your profile information (including profile pictures) now automatically syncs with the team members display, and notification emails are matched with the correct team member addresses!

## Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Option A: Automated Setup (Recommended)

```bash
cd "project CR/dashboard/project-cr-app"
./setup-profile-sync.sh
```

### Option B: Manual Setup

1. **Apply Migration** - Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and run: supabase/migrations/20251002000000_link_team_members_with_profiles.sql
   ```

2. **Sync Existing Data** - In Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and run: sync-team-members-with-profiles.sql
   ```

3. **Done!** ✅

## Test It Out

### Test Profile Picture Sync:
1. Go to `/profile` page
2. Upload a profile picture
3. Click "Update Profile"
4. Navigate to `/team` page
5. ✅ Your picture appears in the team list!

### Test Email Matching:
1. Assign a task to yourself
2. Check that the email notification arrives
3. ✅ It uses your profile email address!

## How It Works

```
User Signs Up
    ↓
Profile Created (with email)
    ↓
Auto-Link to team_members (by email)
    ↓
Profile Picture & Info → Team Display
    ↓
Notification Emails → Profile Email
```

## What Changed?

- ✅ Still works for team members without accounts

### Notification Emails
- ✅ Checks database for current email addresses
- ✅ Uses profile email if user signed up
- ✅ Falls back to team_members email
- ✅ Maintains backwards compatibility

### Profile Updates
- ✅ Changes sync instantly to team display
- ✅ Email changes update notification recipients
- ✅ No manual sync needed

## Benefits

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Profile Pictures | ❌ Not shown | ✅ Auto-sync to team list |
| Email Updates | ❌ Hardcoded | ✅ Dynamic from database |
| Team Info | ❌ Static data | ✅ Real-time from profiles |
| User Control | ❌ Admin only | ✅ Users can update own info |

## Files Changed

1. **`/app/api/team-members/route.ts`** - Joins profiles with team_members
2. **`/lib/gmail-email-service.ts`** - Dynamic email lookup from database
3. **Migration files** - Auto-linking triggers and sync scripts

## Troubleshooting

**Profile picture not showing?**
```sql
-- Check linking status in Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT tm.name, tm.profile_id, p.avatar_url
FROM team_members tm
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON tm.profile_id = p.id;
```

**Wrong email receiving notifications?**
- Update your email in `/profile` page
- Changes apply immediately to future notifications

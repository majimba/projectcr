# Debugging Notifications Loading Issue

## Current Status
The notification dropdown is showing "Loading notifications..." spinner indefinitely.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open your browser's developer console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) and look for:
- `[Notifications] Starting fetch` - Should show if user is authenticated
- `[Notifications] Fetching from API...` - Shows the fetch started
- `[Notifications] Response status:` - Shows HTTP response code
- `[Notifications] Data received:` - Shows the data structure
- `[Notifications] Fetch complete` - Should show when done

### 2. Check Network Tab
In developer tools, go to Network tab and:
- Click on the notification bell
- Look for request to `/api/notifications`
- Check:
  - **Status Code**: Should be 200
  - **Response**: Should be JSON with `{notifications: [], unreadCount: 0, totalCount: 0}`
  - **Time**: How long it takes

### 3. Common Issues

**Issue: Request hangs/times out**
- **Symptom**: Console shows "Request timeout after 5s"
- **Cause**: API endpoint is blocking
- **Fix**: Check if Supabase connection is working

**Issue: Response is HTML instead of JSON**
- **Symptom**: Console error "Unexpected token '<'"
- **Cause**: API is returning error page
- **Fix**: Check server logs for actual error

**Issue: User not authenticated**
- **Symptom**: Console shows "user: not authenticated"
- **Cause**: User session expired or not logged in
- **Fix**: Log in again

**Issue: Loading never ends**
- **Symptom**: Spinner keeps rotating, no console errors
- **Cause**: `setLoading(false)` not being called
- **Fix**: Check if try/catch/finally is working properly

### 4. Manual API Test

Test the API directly from terminal:
```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3000/api/notifications
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "notifications": [],
  "unreadCount": 0,
  "totalCount": 0
}
```

### 5. Quick Fixes

**If API hangs:**
1. Restart the dev server
2. Check Supabase connection
3. Verify `.env.local` has correct credentials

**If authentication issues:**
1. Log out and log back in
2. Clear cookies and local storage
3. Check browser console for auth errors

## What to Report

If still having issues, please share:
1. **Browser Console Log**: Copy all `[Notifications]` messages
2. **Network Tab**: Screenshot of the `/api/notifications` request
3. **Server Logs**: Any errors in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
4. **User Status**: Are you logged in? Can you see the profile dropdown?

## Next Steps

With the debug logs added, when you click the notification bell, you should see detailed information in the console about what's happening at each step. This will help identify exactly where the process is getting stuck.
